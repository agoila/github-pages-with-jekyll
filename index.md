# Welcome to my blog

Namaste! 

My name is Ankit and I work as a Software Engineer at AVL North America. Originally hailing from a small town in Delhi, India, I completed my education in 2014 and currently reside in Ann Arbor, Michigan (it was recently voted one of the best college towns in the country!!!). Besides my quintessential 9-5 job, I am passionate about photography, camping/backpacking/hiking adventures, tinkering/hacking, playing the Violin and volunteering for animals. 

Through this blog, I plan to share some of these activities in the form of either DIY blog posts, travelogues, vlogs or interesting stories/observations. Hope you have fun reading/experimenting/experiencing them, and feel free to post comments and/or contact me for details. 

I'm active on social media as well - find me on Instagram, Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook! 

Adios!
